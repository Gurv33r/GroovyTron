# GroovyTron

This project is a Python3 script that serves as a command-line interface for bot accounts on Twitter.

## Info Needed Beforehand

*Users of this project will need to create a .txt file beforehand in the same directory as this script*, containing their account's: 
   **consumer key
   consumer secret
   bearer token (just for good measure)
   access token
   secret access token**

A guide to finding these keys and tokens can be found here: https://themepacific.com/how-to-generate-api-key-consumer-token-access-key-for-twitter-oauth/994/

*The script requires this information to be formatted in a specific way inside the txt file*:
      **consumer_key: ENTER CONSUMER KEY HERE
      consumer_secret: ENTER CONSUMER SECRET HERE
      bearer_token: ENTER BEARER TOKEN HERE
      access_token: ENTER ACCESS TOKEN HERE
      access_secret: ENTER ACCESS SECRET HERE**

Users should now be able to run the script properly

## Running The Project

Project runs as a normal Python3 file. Users will be prompted to enter char values in order for the script to determine what the user wants to do with it.

**Currently this projects only supports tweeting text through the bot account.**
